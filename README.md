# Compiler
Basic Compiler for Calculation and Text Editting...

It uses Scheme(STk) Language (Dialect of Lisp) to operate. The reason behind this is because of scheme's ability to use recursive functions easily.
It helped to remove any inconsistencies and come up with an elegant solution.

This Compiler is based on substitution model of evaluation. It should be run on top of an interpreter like Racket or STk.
The main features are:
1. Doing Complex Operations with Numbers.
2. Performing basic editting tasks with Strings.
