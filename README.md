# Compiler
Basic Compiler for Calculation and Text Editting...

It uses Scheme(STk) Language (Dialect of Lisp) to operate. The reason behind this is because of scheme's ability to use recursive functions easily.
It helped to remove any inconsistencies and come up with an elegant solution.

This Compiler is based on substitution model of evaluation. It requires Racket for functioning.

The main features are:
1. Doing Complex Operations with Numbers.
2. Performing basic editting tasks with Strings.

This Compiler was made using the code from University of California Berkeley, It provided the functionality for simple numerical operations.
